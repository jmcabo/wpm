# wpm
Similar to the old version of Type Racer, written from scratch, using some of the most popular paragraphs quotations. It measures Words per Minute and errors.

Written entirely in Javascript and html, it only requires jquery.
Everything is entirely contained in a single .html:

With this, you can learn to touch type **without using the Cloud**, and edit the file and add your own paragraphs, in other languages too.
